# LUCAS_Task4
Production of estimates based on satellite imagery and comparison with LUCAS estimates

The processing is aimed at:
1. recovering the information deducible from the satellite images of Sentinel 1 and Sentinel 2 relating to an EU country;
2. using this information together with that collected by the LUCAS surveys of 2018 and 2018 to estimate models (randomForest) capable of predicting the values ​​of "land cover" for all the points of the master of a given country;
3. comparing the estimates obtained from the LUCAS surveys with those obtained as counts of the predicted values ​​for all the points of the master.
